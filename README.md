# MasterProject

## Description
The source code of this project is mainly divided into two parts: the front end and the back end. The front end is primarily developed using HBuilder X, while the back end is developed using Node.js and Nest.js. The Python scripts in the 'Python Script' folder are already included in the BackEnd/Py folder for easy reference to the relevant scripts.

## Front End setup
Step 1: Download HBuilder X and open the source code project in the FrontEnd folder.
Step 2: Install an Android emulator on your local machine, such as LDPlayer.
Step 3: In HBuilder X, click the run button and select 4. Run to Android App Base.
Step 4: Please ensure that the Android emulator is correctly opened on your local machine. Select the emulator from the list and click the run button.
